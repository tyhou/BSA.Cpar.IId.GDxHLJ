Cryptosporidium is a major cause of severe diarrhea. Although Cryptosporidium isolates exhibit significant differences in infectivity and virulence, the genetic determinants for these traits are not clear. In this study, we used classical genetics to cross two Cryptosporidium parvum isolates of different virulence and used bulk segregant analysis of whole-genome sequences from the progeny to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with Cryptosporidium infectivity and virulence. Of the 23 genes in three QTL, two had loss-of-function mutations in the low-virulence isolates, including the SKSR1 gene encoding a variant secretory protein. Deletion of the SKSR1 gene or expression of the frame-shifted sequence reduced the pathogenicity of the virulent isolate. SKSR1 is expressed in small granules and secreted into the parasite-host interface during invasion. These results demonstrate that SKSR1 is an important virulence factor in Cryptosporidium, and suggest that the extended SKSR protein family, encoded by clusters of subtelomeric genes, may contribute to pathogenesis.
